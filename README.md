# Toy Factory

This project is a DTx prototype for diagnosing ADHD, using VR.

It is a game that evaluates the player's performance based on evaluation criteria in **[DSM-V](https://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596).**

This project supports the following features:
- Customizable data containers within the Unity Editor
- Real-time HMD and VR controller movement tracking

> **Note**<br>
> This project requires a VR SDK called [VR Interaction Framework](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/vr-interaction-framework-161066) by [Bearded Ninja Games](http://beardedninjagames.com/) to properly work in Unity.
